<h2>What is Thrifting</h2>
<p>Thrifting is a unique shopping experience that elicits different feelings. Some people love the hunt for clothes amongst large piles in physical stores. On the other hand, others would rather go for an organized experience in retail stores. 

    Thrifting holds many connotations. As people continue to seek new ways of creative expression, you’ve probably heard someone mention that they’re going thrifting. However, in simple terms, going thrifting means shopping for secondhand goods at stores.
    <h3>DEFINING THRIFTING</h3>
 </p>
    <p>Thrifting is the act and process of buying used items, also known as thrifted items, from secondhand stores. Instead of buying from a regular retail chain, many people visit local second-hand stores to find interesting items. 

        Unlike regular stores where you can find more than one piece of an item, thrift stores often stock unique items. As a result, from the early history of thrift shopping to the current day, thrifting allows you to discover fun finds. 
        
        People go thrifting for different reasons and to find different things. As we become more conscious of the fashion industry's environmental impact, thrifting has quickly become an alternative to fast fashion. It has become a source of sustainable fashion due to its principles of reusing and repurposing. 
        
        Unlike fast fashion stores, when thrifting, you can give new life to old items. Although clothing stores are popular, you’ll also find a host of other items. Some stores sell household items, accessories, bags, furniture, and unique vintage finds. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Whether you walk into a physical store or are exploring a flea market, you’re sure you’ll be saving money. Apart from that, you’ll be shopping for secondhand goods that have enough life in them to serve you. 

With the popularity of social media, thrift shopping is taking a new turn. Although many people enjoy the physical thrifting experience, online thrift shopping is also taking center stage and becoming more popular.

<h2>Types of thrifting</h2>
<p><h3>The Resellers</h3>
    As we mentioned earlier, the resale industry is booming. Many people walk into thrift stores not to shop for personal items but to look for items to resell. 
    
    These people visit local stores to shop for items that they can stock for their business. Usually, this type of person is a small business owner who has turned their hand to selling used clothes online. Alternatively, the person might also be buying to upcycle or repurpose items for resale. This could be either selling online or at flea markets. When such a person buys clothes or other pieces, theyll sell them for higher prices to make a profit. </p>
    <p>
        <h3>The Stylists and Treasure Finders</h3>
These people are all about discovering unique items. They are like thrift gurus who know where to look to find one-of-a-kind pieces. These people enjoy the thrill and fun of finding interesting pieces that you wouldn't find elsewhere and often have a knack for finding items in a particular style. 

Whether it’s clothing, accessories, or furniture, these people love building collections. Once they walk into a store, they’re determined to search for vintage and generally cool items while exploring the shelves and piles.
    </p>
    <p>
        <h3>The Savers </h3>
We’ve already established that a thrift store will sell items at a low or discounted price. As a result, you’ll be saving a lot of money by shopping at these stores. 

Shopping at a thrift store allows many people to ensure savings on everyday clothing items. This could be out of necessity, in the case of low-income earners, or just a conscious choice. In general, thrifting allows you to save money.
    </p>
    <p>
        <h3>The Eco-Warriors</h3>
Thrifting can serve as a sustainable fashion practice. As a result, people get into thrifting as a form of dedication to reducing their environmental footprint. 

Fast fashion has significant effects on the environment - from its production to its disposal. Instead of contributing to this, many eco-warriors turn to thrifting. This supports reusing old items rather than watching them being thrown out. There’s always something looking for a new owner in a thrift store.

    <p>
        Most people enjoy the thrill of going thrifting. It’s unlike any other shopping experience. 
    
    Unlike regular retail stores where you can predict what you’ll find, thrifting is like an adventure. It often requires patience and some digging through piles. However, many people describe it as a rewarding experience once they find something unique. 
    
    Second-hand stores exist in various forms, and you can find just about anything. Some shops focus on just clothing. You’ll also find others that sell a mix of many things. Whether online or physically, you can find clothing, furniture, books, bedding, appliances, outdoor items, toys, and more. Thrifting opens up the doors for creativity. It gives you room to find new uses for old items. As a result, you’ll find many people upcycling or repurposing old pieces. On the other hand, you can also use your purchased items as they are. 
    </p>

        <h3>1. THRIFTING IS GOOD FOR THE ENVIRONMENT.</h3>
    Shop with purpose. Thrifting is gentler on the environment by reducing pollution and waste. The average American throws away 81 pounds of clothes PER YEAR. That adds up to around 26 BILLION pounds of clothing going right to landfills. Thrifting is recycling. Point blank. By choosing preloved items over newly produced pieces, you're shrinking your carbon footprint. You're limiting the amount of natural resources it takes to create new fabric, make the clothing, and ship it hundreds or thousands of miles to the store. Giving a used item new life rescues it from those 26 billion pounds going to the landfill by keeping it in circulation. And when you're done with it, you can donate it again for someone else to find and love. It's a gift that keeps giving. 
    </p>
</div>



    <div class="fun-2">
    <p>
        <h3>2. THRIFTING IS GOOD FOR YOUR WALLET.</h3>
    Most thrift stores offer extremely low prices compared to their retail counterparts. It's common sense that the more money you can save, the better off you'll be. There's no feeling that's more rewarding than scoring an awesome secondhand jewel for a fraction of its original cost. Despite being less expensive, secondhand items are often actually better quality than new ones. It's a good sign if it's so durable that it lasted long enough to be donated. The longer it lasts, the longer it stays out of the landfill.
    </p>
</div>


    <div class="fun-3">
    <p>
        <h3>3. THRIFTING IS GOOD FOR YOUR COMMUNITY.</h3>
    Many thrift shops serve some charitable cause, whether it be job training and placement, funding a mission of some kind, or simply providing impoverished communities an affordable shopping option. Not to mention giving your money to local shops puts it right back into your local community. It's much easier to track where your clothes and goods have traveled. Instead of having been shipped halfway across the world, thrifted items are locally sourced.
    </p>
</div>


    <div class="fun-4">
    <p>
        <h3>4. THRIFTING IS GOOD FOR THE GLOBE.</h3>
    In addition to being nice to the planet, thrifting is nice to people. Buying secondhand reduces both new items being produced AND the need for someone to produce them. Mass production often comes at the cost of human rights. Women, children, and impoverished people are usually at the highest risk for worker rights violations--low wages, long hours, poor working conditions, etc. So while you can certainly seek ethically-sources items, nothing is more ethical than recycled goods. 
    </p>
</div>


    <div class="fun-5">
    <p>
        <h3>5. THRIFTING IS GOOD FOR YOUR WARDROBE.</h3>
        Unleash your creativity. Create your own unique style. Stand out from the crowd. You have to get creative and think outside the box when you shop secondhand. It's an exciting challenge to style something old to look new. You'll find one-of-a-kind pieces for your closet or your home. They each tell a story and have a unique, mysterious history. And good news: vintage is IN. Trends cycle in and out of style, which means there thrift stores are chock full of treasures that are good for the environment and great for your aesthetic.

<h2>How does it helps nature</h2>
<p>
    <h3>Keeps Clothes Out of Landfills</h3>
Think back to that reduce, reuse, recycle slogan we’ve all been taught since elementary school. When we were first taught this, it typically had to deal with plastics and paper. Many people don’t realize that recycling incorporates more than the typical plastics and includes textile recycling as well. Just because you’re not putting your clothes in the blue bin and leaving them at the edge of the road doesn’t mean thrifting is not an important form of recycling. One of thrifting’s biggest advantages for the planet is that it keeps clothes out of landfills. People now more than ever are recognizing that the clothes they no longer want will make much more of an impact when donated and brought to thrift stores, rather than tossed in the garbage. When clothes are thrown away, they sit in landfills for hundreds of years. Especially now that a lot of clothing is made out of synthetic material that won’t degrade, these clothes tossed into landfills take up a vast amount of space and contribute to the greenhouse gases plaguing our planet. Even clothes made out of organic materials won’t biodegrade properly in landfills and will output methane gas. When people donate clothes and shop secondhand, they’re playing a great role in keeping clothes out of landfills.
</p>
<p>
<h3>Lowers Your Carbon Footprint</h3>
    Another significant way thrifting is good for the planet is that it lowers your carbon footprint. This is another one of those phrases we were taught young—carbon footprint. We often think that the only way we can do this is by biking to work instead of driving or by reducing our shower time. Though these are wonderful ways, thrifting is one of those steps to reducing our carbon footprint that doesn’t take much effort. All it asks is that you head to a thrift store rather than engage in online or fast-fashion shopping! We mention fast fashion because now more than ever, a ton of energy goes into clothing manufacturing. The whole process—transportation of raw materials to the production processes and shipping to stores—takes up a plethora of energy and time. The fashion industry is moving faster than ever, creating millions of clothing items every day to fill up the stores every week. When you buy secondhand, you’re preventing that massive waste of energy and resources on the production of new clothes. Thrifting is an easy way to make a difference in your own carbon footprint and take the small steps to lower the world’s.
</p>
<p>
<h3> Helps Preserve Water</h3>
    In a similar sense, thrifting helps preserve water. Like we’ve mentioned, clothing production is a process that takes up a lot of time and energy; it also uses a lot of water—water that we need dearly and are slowly running low on. Water consumption is extremely high in every single stage of clothing production. Take a cotton T-shirt, for example. When made unsustainably, even simply growing one kilogram of cotton requires at least 10,000 liters of water. That’s just the beginning of the production process. There’s wet processing and printing, packaging and transportation processes—all these steps add to the overall water consumption. When you shop secondhand, you’re playing a part in preserving water. As we’ve stated, textile recycling is a part of the whole “reduce, reuse, recycle” mentality, and water preservation is just as important as that. When you recycle clothing—either donating or buying secondhand—you’re preserving water. It’s just as important as driving less, eating green, and shutting off the faucet while you brush your teeth.
</p>
<p>
<h3>Reduces Chemical Pollution</h3>
    Another great way that thrifting helps the planet is that it reduces the chemical pollution induced by creating and buying new clothes. Let’s think back to cotton—the production of cotton not only uses tons of water, but it’s also highly pesticide intensive. This means that when cotton is produced and manufactured, it causes soil acidification and water contamination. And this is from material that many people consider sustainable. In general, textile-manufacturing processes involve the use of harmful dyes and crude oil by-products. The process of creating and shipping new clothes contaminates surface and groundwater, pollutes the air, and so much more. Shopping secondhand begins to eliminate the constant chemical pollution that results from clothing production. In general, when we take the time to shop the clothes that are readily available to us in secondhand and thrift stores, we’re not only finding those unique products that match our beautiful personalities, but we’re helping the planet as well. There are so many wonderful benefits of thrift shopping, and when we take the time to visit and shop these special places, we’ll get to reap those rewards. The next time you’re looking for something special, turn to a 2nd Avenue Thrift Store, one of the best thrifting opportunities in Philadelphia. We’ll make sure you find those pieces you’ve been dreaming of and benefit the planet in the process!

    <h2>How can one do thrifting</h2>
   <div class="learnthrift-2">
 <p>
        <b>Sell before you buy.</b>  Selling a few items that you are no longer using can help you save money for your thrifting and create storage space for your upcoming purchases. You can sell your items online or at a consignment shop before you load up on thrift store finds.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Find out the store’s specialty beforehand.</b>  You can make the thrift shopping experience much easier if you know what the store carries. Some thrift shops specialize in clothing or toys, while others will have a wide array of furniture or home décor. Before heading out, find out which store stocks more of the specific items you’re looking for, and search there first.
</p>
<p>
<b>Dress appropriately.</b>  Many thrift stores don’t have fitting rooms, so you might need to wear something you can easily slip secondhand clothing over to try on. Secondhand stores usually don’t offer refunds, so you want to make sure your clothing fits before you buy it.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Give yourself a clear goal.</b>  Thrift shopping should be about finding things you need, not meandering around looking to collect items. Take note of the things you already own, then make a mental list of the things you’re looking for. If you need to, take pictures with your smartphone to help you remember what you have and what you want.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Get your items tailored.</b>  One of the few disadvantages of thrifting is that you may find the perfect piece, but it may not fit properly. This can be an easy fix: If it’s a quality find, take it to a tailor. Or, if you’re confident in your sewing and hemming abilities, you can attempt a DIY tailoring job to make your item fit just right.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Know when the stores restock.</b>  Most stores are busiest on the weekend, and many quality goods may be gone by then. Pay attention to when your local thrift stores restock new items and try not to wait too long to check them out.
</p>
<p>
   <b>Avoid impulse buys.</b>  Thrift stores may have low prices, but it can start to add up if you buy enough items. Set a budget and leave your cards at home. Taking a cash-only approach will help you stick to your list of needs and help you avoid overspending.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Learn how to discern quality.</b>  Consignment stores can offer designer brands, vintage items, or other high-end quality pieces with low price tags that you can find if you know what to look for. Natural materials will often be of higher quality than synthetic ones. Shoes made of 100 percent leather usually have the words “Vero Cuoio” marked on the bottom, which is the Italian phrase for “true leather.” Blazers with linings and wool-blend coats will also be more expensive items than other materials. Get familiar with high-quality tells to discern which items will be worth the money.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Shop off-season.</b>  Like with retail stores, the best time to buy seasonal clothing is when the demand is low. Shop for jackets and boots in the summer, and look for sundresses and sandals in the winter.
